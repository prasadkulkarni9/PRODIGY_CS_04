This Python script is a keylogger that records keyboard input and saves it to a local text file.
It captures keystrokes at regular intervals and stores them in memory. The logged data is periodically written to a file, with each session identified by a unique filename based on start and end times. 
The script runs continuously until terminated by the user (typically using CTRL+C).
